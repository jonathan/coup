          <p>Coup is a card game by <a name="indie-boards-and-cards"
            class="anchor" href="http://www.indieboardsandcards.com">Indie
            Boards and Cards</a> about bluffing and deception. Players start
the game with 2 face down cards representing the influence they
have in the government and 2 coins. When they loose all of their
influence then they are eliminated from the game.</p>

<p>People can be removed from the game by being couped for 7 coins or
being assassinated. The intrigue and bluffing come in with the face
down influence cards. Anyone may claim to be any number of different
roles including an assassin. If you bluff and are called out, though,
then you will loose one of your influence cards instead.</p>

<p>This is a simple project to explore the different aspects of
the clojure programming language. There is currently some simple AI
and a basic way to use a genetic algorithm to evolve smarter AI. The
goals of this project are to expand my knowledge of various AI as
well as explore clojure more.</p>
