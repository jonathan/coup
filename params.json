{"name":"Coup","tagline":"","body":"Coup is a card game about intrigue and deception. Players start\r\nthe game with 2 face down cards representing the influence they\r\nhave in the government and 2 coins. When they loose all of their\r\ninfluence then they are eliminated from the game.\r\n\r\nPeople can be removed from the game by being couped for 7 coins or\r\nbeing assassinated. The intrigue and bluffing come in with the face\r\ndown influence cards. Anyone may claim to be any number of different\r\nroles including an assassin. If you bluff and are called out, though,\r\nthen you will loose one of your influence cards instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple project to explore the different aspects of\r\nthe clojure programming language. There is currently some simple AI\r\nand a basic way to use a genetic algorithm to evolve smarter AI. The\r\ngoals of this project are to expand my knowledge of various AI as\r\nwell as explore clojure more.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
